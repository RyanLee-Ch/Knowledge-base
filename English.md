#### A Day In the Little House:
The morning sunlight spilled through the window onto the bed, gently waking Mia. She stretched and adjusted her pillow, then glanced at the nightstand where her laptop sat beside a piture frame. After slipping into her slippers, she walked to the bathroom sink to brush her teeth with a toothbrush and toothpaste. The mirror reflected her sleepy face as she reached for the face wash.

In the kitchen, Mia turned on the induction cooker to boil water in a kettle. She grabbed a bowl and chopsticks from the drawer, then stirred oatmeal with a spoon. The range hood hummed softly as she opened the fridge for milk. Suddenly, her wireless speaker played a notification——her roomate Lily was video-calling. Mia hurried to the living room, nearly tripping over the charging cable on the computer desk.

“Mia! Can you check the USB port? My mouse isn’t working!” Lily’s voice echoed through the monitor. Mia sighed and crouched under the table, fiddling with the PC case. A USB drive was plugged into the wrong port. “Fixed it!” she said, wiping dust off the keyboard.

By afternoon, rain tapped against the balcony’s curtain. Mia grabbed an umbrella and stepped outside to rescue clothes from the drying rack. Back inside, she lit an incense stick to calm herself, then flopped onto the sofa with a remote to watch TV. The AC hummed faintly as she dozed off.

Evening arrived. Lily returned, tossing her backpack onto the stool. They cooked stir-fry in a wok, seasoned with salt and soy sauce, while arguing over whose turn it was to take out the trash can. After dinner, Mia plugged her phone into the charger and collapsed onto the mattress, staring at the ceiling light.

“Another ordinary day,” she whispered, as the switch clicked off.


#### The Humming Apartment:
As dawn light filtered through the keyhole of her bedroom door, Mia stumbled toward the wardrobe, her quilt still draped over her shoulders. The washing machine's rhythmic thumps downstairs vibrated through the clothes pole mounted on the ceiling. "Need to fix that door handle someday," she mumbled, nearly tripping over her mouse pad left carelessly on the floor.

In the kitchen, the rice cooker chirped completion beside a stack of plates. She plugged her nasal irrigator into the socket below the microwave, its blue LED reflecting in the stainless steel dustpan leaning against the wall. A forgotten hanger swayed on the refrigerator handle like a metallic pendulum.

Her gaming PC hummed awake in the study, graphics card fans whirring to life. "Where's the damn data cable?" she muttered, moving shampoo bottles and body wash containers on the desk. A towel draped over the water heater rippled as the hair dryer on the shelf suddenly tipped over.

By twilight, Mia sat cross-legged on the cooler, mop leaning against the wardrobe as she wiped sweat with tissue. The microphone on her headset caught her exhausted chuckle: "Tomorrow I'll organize... maybe." Outside, the streetlamp's glow turned the window into a golden plate against the deepening blue.



#### The Coxistence of Busyness and Tranquility

It was a bright Saturday morning, and Mei stepped out of her apartment gate into the quiet residential area. A gentle breeze rustled the leaves in the greenbelt beside the sidewalk, and she could already hear the distant hum of traffic on the main road. Ahead, a line of streetlamps arched over the street, their tall poles casting delicate shadows even under the morning sunlight.

She locked her bike in the bike shed behind the guardhouse, then crossed the street at the crosswalk toward the corner café. The signpost pointed the way: “Café Lumière →”. Inside, the warm indoor lighting and the soft glow of a pendant light over each table welcomed her. Mei ordered a latte and found a seat by the window, where she could watch the people outside strolling along the wide sidewalk.

After finishing her coffee, she passed McDonald’s and KFC—both fast food restaurants marked with warning signs reminding customers to "Mind the Step". A fire hydrant stood near the curb, while a surveillance camera hung silently from a nearby signal tower. The everyday city scenes surrounded her—familiar, yet full of life.

Turning onto a quieter street, Mei saw a flower bed blooming with daisies beside a small pavilion. A few elderly people were resting under it, chatting. Further ahead, a distribution box was fixed on the wall of an office building, its sleek design blending into the modern surroundings.

Eventually, she arrived at the subway station. Holding the handrail, she took the escalator down into the cool, air‑conditioned interior. She passed the stairs, elevators, and tactile paving designed for the visually impaired. It was a different world underground—structured, efficient, yet quiet.

After exiting the next station, rain had started to fall lightly. Clouds rolled overhead, and she walked briskly past a shopping mall where a grand chandelier lit the entrance. Reflections shimmered on manhole covers, warning lights blinked near a charging station, and the city pulsed with a quiet energy.

Finally, she arrived at the library—a landmark building with a tall clock tower. The indoor warmth and soft lighting felt comforting. As she settled into a reading nook, surrounded by books and silence, she smiled. Outside, the city carried on—busy and bright. But here, she found her quiet place.
